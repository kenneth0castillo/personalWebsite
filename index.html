                ABOUT ME
            </p>
            <p id="t">
                My name in Kenneth Castillo and I am what you may call a young minority but even though I am
                minority it wont stop me from succeeding in life. Although I may have less privilage than people 
                of other races it wont be a handicap that will maintain for a long time. I am currently learning multiple
                coding/programing languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and PYTHON. i am currently in he process 
                of learning coding/ programing languages so that I build some sort of footing in the tech industry.
                I will need this footing in the future because i plan to stay in the tech side of things as a career, 
                and not only as a career but as a passion/hobby of mine.
                <!-- My name is Kenneth Castillo, altough I might seen young you can trust that I do know multiple things. One of my most honrable skills to date is that I know coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and in th eprocess of learning PYTHON. And i am acheiveing all of this at the ripe old age of 15 and Idont plan on slowing down I am planning on continuing my studies in computer science and robotics at college where I plan to get degrees in multiple areas such as robotics and in computer science,        </p> -->
