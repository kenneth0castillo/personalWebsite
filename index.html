                ABOUT ME
            </p>
            <p class="t">
                    My name in Kenneth Castillo and I am what you may call a young minority but even though I am
                minority it wont stop me from succeeding in life. Although I may have less privilege than people 
                of other races it wont be a handicap that will maintain for a long time. I am currently learning multiple
                coding/programing languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and PYTHON. I am currently in he process
                of learning coding/ programing languages so that I build some sort of footing in the tech industry.
                I will need this footing in the future because I plan to stay in the tech side of things as a career,
                and not only as a career but as a passion/hobby of mine.
            </p>
            <P class="t">
                    Not only do I have a passion of coding but one of my many passions is also drawing and although I'm not the
                best 'artist', I am incredibly dedicated and will purse my hobbies to the very end. And although I might not make a career
                out of it I hope to be able to turn it into a second income. And although I might not turn this in to a fully fledged career but I will try to find a way to be able to
                to incorporate the art and computer science or into architecture and this will allow me to be creative while still being able to make a living doing
                what I love and being able to survive off of it.
            </P>
                <!-- My name is Kenneth Castillo, although I might seen young you can trust that I do know multiple things. One of my most honorable skills to date is that I know coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and in the process of learning PYTHON. And I am achieving all of this at the ripe old age of 15 and I don't plan on slowing down I am planning on continuing my studies in computer science and robotics at college where I plan to get degrees in multiple areas such as robotics and in computer science,        </p> -->
